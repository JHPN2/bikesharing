The preliminary results of the analysis indicate that bike sharing is a emerging form of transportation within a dense urban environment as indicated by the data based on New York City. Let's examine the first visual.

This visual focuses on the duration in which a bike is utilized vs the number of bikes checked out. As indicated in the data, the majority of all rides fall within a max duration of 20 minutes. Meaning that the bikes are used in short point-to-point trips within the city. A further break down by Gender, as indicated in with the next visual, tells us the majority of riders who use a bike share service are Males.

The next three visualizations will focus on the time of day these rides are taking place. The first of the three visualizations is a heat map that shows us a general indication for all genders and user types of the most popular times per day of the week with which the bikes are used. The data indicates that on weekdays the use of bikes are highest during peak am and pm rush hours while on weekends, the use is generally more spread out throughout the daylight hours. Breaking down by Gender further, we see that the shape of the pattern for both Male and Female riders are similar, but the intensity with the Male pattern indicates more riders are male. If we break this down further by user type (Customer vs Subscriber) as indicated on the third heat map, we see that subscribers make up the majority of the ridership. This indicates that the majority of users who utilize the service use it as their primary means of travel within the city

Finally, let's analyze the age of these riders. The final two visuals will help us to understand the age demographics of these riders. The first visual breaks down the Male/Female age vs. the number of rides. The results indicate that for both Male and Females, the majority of riders fall within the birth years 1975 to around 1995, meaning our riders are around 20 to 45 years old. We can break this down further by usertype in the last visual.
